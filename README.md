# DSA3101 Hackathon

This hackathon was organised by [Kantar](http://www.kantar.com/), a Data Analytics Consulting Company and the National University of Singapore's Data Analytics Consulting Centre for students enrolled in the DSA3101 module in AY20/21 Semester 1. 

This hackathon comes in the form of three assignments: each assignment requires the use of various data analysis / machine learning techniques in order to gain useful insights which might aid the business of the client, where the client in this case has provided three datasets. It is implied that the data was collected in Malaysia, and is gleaned from several chains of supermarkets there. The customers and their demographics are likely to have been obtained from the information they provided in their membership details to the client. 

We were expected to work as a team to produce some actionable insights; the notebooks I will be uploading are my contributions.

The certificate which indicates my participation in the hackathon is attached below.
